Amazon Clone Website Using HTML and CSS

The Amazon Clone Website project focuses on designing and developing a static e-commerce web interface similar to the Amazon homepage using HTML and CSS. The main objective of this project is to understand the fundamentals of web structure, layout design, and responsive styling without using any backend technologies or JavaScript.

In this project, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the basic structure of the website, including the header, navigation bar, search box, product sections, banners, and footer. Each webpage element is carefully organized using semantic HTML tags such as header, nav, section, div, and footer to ensure readability and maintainability of the code.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the website and make it visually similar to Amazon’s user interface. CSS is applied for layout design, colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, hover effects, and overall responsiveness. Modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid are used to align product cards, navigation menus, and content sections effectively. Media queries are also implemented to make the website responsive across different screen sizes like mobile, tablet, and desktop.# Amazon-Clone-Website-
